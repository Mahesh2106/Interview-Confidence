Interview Confidence Project

Overview :-

The Interview Confidence project is designed to empower individuals by enhancing their interview skills through a comprehensive technological solution. Leveraging the power of machine learning and computer vision, this project aims to provide users with valuable insights and feedback to boost their confidence during job interviews.

The project includes a Registartion Page , Login Page , Home Page and a Emotion_Analysis. The resultant confidence is expressed both in Pie chart and Bar-Graph Representation , and also confidence level,non confidence percentage is also included.

Features :-

1. Interview Simulation

The project incorporates a realistic interview simulation environment. Users can practice answering common interview questions, allowing them to become familiar with the interview process and refine their responses.

2. Facial Expression Analysis

Utilizing OpenCV, the project includes facial expression analysis to evaluate users' non-verbal communication. This feature helps users understand how their facial expressions may impact the perception of their responses, enabling them to make necessary adjustments.


3. Personalized Feedback

Based on the analysis of interview performance, users receive personalized feedback on areas of improvement. This feature aims to guide users in refining their body language, and overall interview presence.

4. Real-time Confidence Metrics

The project provides real-time confidence metrics to users during the interview simulation. This includes an analysis of speech patterns, pacing, and pauses, helping users identify areas where they may need to adjust their delivery.

Technologies Used :-

TensorFlow: Deep learning framework utilized for machine learning tasks.
Keras: High-level neural networks API used in conjunction with TensorFlow for building and training machine learning models.
